# COMM329 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
By Holly Rossmann

This is a traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a video game-like twist. The player is put up against a guard, and must beat him in this duel to survive. Every loss makes the player or opponent lose a heart. After 3 hearts lost - it is game over! The game mechanics and logic were created using Javascript, and page design was created using HTML and CSS.
